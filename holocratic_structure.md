# Holocratic Structure

This organization will use version [4.1 of the Holocracy Constitution](https://github.com/holacracyone/Holacracy-Constitution)

##Apps
[Badge-based compensation structure](http://www.holacracy.org/badge-based-compensation-app/) fork
- Skills, levels in those skills
- Add badge: support. Easy to get one, but doesn't pay much extra. Harder to get higher levels, but pays a lot. Get levels by being nominated by increasingly others for being helpful
- The relationship between compensation and badge level should follow a formula so that the formula can be changed by consensus and everyone's pay grade is adjusted
