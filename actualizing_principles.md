# Actualizing Principles

Recognizing:
-that the creation of intellectual properties on behalf of a goods or services provider involves the promotion of these goods and services in an environment saturated by similar promotions,
-that this saturated environment conduces hyper-stimulation(cite),
-that hyper-stimulation can lead to unconsidered consequences by overwhelming the mind's perception filter(cite),
-and that given access to information about a product and not influenced by the outlined deception techniques, prospective buyers will tend toward the parity product with the greatest value;
this effort commits to creating intellectual properties which objectively and minimally represent their product.

Recognizing:
-that works created in the pursuit of technical committment at expense are more expensive to develop,
-that works created for profit at the expense of technical committment are inherently harder to maintain and upgrade,
-that these profit-focused products are created by individuals who prioritize their employment status over only doing that which they are talented or inspired to perform
-that while life and livelihood has never been necessarily dependent on monetary throughput, there is a historical tradition of their association in which the majority of humanity including this effort currently engages,
this effort commits to developing a method that provides work proportionally for its members determined by their talent, inspiration, and ability alone. This proportioning may seem unequal, so care must be taken to ensure consensus on this method.



We hold these statements to be true:
-Web pages are always changing, and the requirements for what they can do are always expanding.
-There have been no perfect websites yet
-While not all open-source software will sustainable, the most sustainable software will be open-source
-The internet is ideally a representation of all human-categorized information about a subject
-Search engines, the primary method through which website are discovered, seek to find the information most relevant to their user's query
-Exaggerating or falsifying information about an organization for the effort of search engine visibility corrupts the internet and will always eventually be eradicated by algorithm

Therefore:
-Internet engineers should seek to create the most-accurate, most-organized version of an organization's information
-Copy on the internet that purports to represent an organization should be factual and defensible
-Because no web project can ever be considered fully complete, internet engineers should seek the highest level of standards-compliance and design systems with infinite outward expansion as a possibility.
-Systems should be modular and upgradable with a minimum amount of work by future engineers
-Requirements for understanding and upgrading a system should be clearly documented in a conspicuous place within the system

These statements provide a sum of these principles:

TRUTH is more important than MONEY
This recognizes that those tasked with creating words and other representations of ideas have made the decision to value money over honest representation and that the world has suffered for it.

OPENNESS is more important than SUCCESS
This recognizes that people have kept facts concealed for the sake of succeeding in a competitive market, and that this has been an expense to the system as a whole for the sake of a few individuals.

In short, this effort intends that work performed at the expense of one's whole self to the benefit of a larger whole will be proportionally more fulfilling, enduring, and useful.

Include notes about sustainability. We are making these systems realizing that while technology changes rapidly and paradigms are upset easily, creating systems which adhere to a high level of abstraction instead of being tossed about by trends will last longer. Following conventions does not inhibit innovation - it may have that appearance but over time the system will, by following conventions, evolve into a more complete system, like a fine garment that is worn over time into the wearer's personality. A system of information is like a piece of clothing: it demonstrates outwardly the wearer's personality, and it provides insulation and security for the wearer. Events may tear holes or change the appearance of the garment, but if it is made of good material, it will adapt and it can be adapted. By understanding the situations which the garment will have to weather, the maker can create an appropriate shield and facade.
