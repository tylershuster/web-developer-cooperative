# What is a Worker's Cooperative?

- Each member is a voting member of equal standing who also performs the work

--

- Members are the primary shareholders

--

# Why a Web Developer Cooperative?

???

Less common because they are localized. Whereas the examples of cooperatives included conglomerations of producers or people buying together to get a discount, workers' cooperatives are run by the people doing the work. Alvarado Street bakery is an example of one you might have heard.

# Idea Map

--

"Web Developers" develop the web of ideas

---

> Anyone who creates content:
>
> - Code
> - Words
> - Videos
> - Images
>
> is in web development.

--

Web developers manufacture or promote ideas.

--

Most of you probably are or know someone who creates one or more of these things

--

The internet allows us to have more than one professional skill.

--

- Some of these skills are specialties

--

- Some of these skills are hobbies

--

Web developers especially are discovering how easy it is becoming to learn all the skills for a business online



???

[1] Painters and writers are the oldest web developers: weaving together meaning into new forms that the public can access.

[2] However,
- While we each may have _most_ of the skills to make a site,
- We _will_ lack a few.
- The areas in which we lack skill become the weak point of the product, and at least personally one of the biggest things stopping us from working for ourselves

[3] I say this because I personally have experienced many sites like this: created by someone really good at one area like user experience, client interaction, or coding, but demonstrating a severe lack in other areas. At least of the local sites I've seen, these sites seem to be created by people who later went to work for a company

## So...

---

# I propose a workers' cooperative of web developers to

- Provide a structure through which members may

--

  - Apply their specialties

--

  - Hone their interests

--

  - Work for a profit

--

- Harness a complete set of talents towards the needs of its clients

???

There's no reason to say a painter couldn't join the cooperative. However, they would need to find a way to become included in a project to get paid

How does stuff get done without a boss?

???

As you may have noticed, the structure of a worker's cooperative counts on each person having equal say. To get things done, one person with equal say could be CEO, and whose job it would be to tell others what to do. But let's not...

# Holocracy


???

In order to manage this decentralization of power, the cooperative will incorporate the principles of holacracy.



---

# What is Holocracy?

[Holocracy](http://holocracy.org) is a governance structure in which the work of the organization is divided into roles, and employees of the company are elected to fill those roles for as long as they exist.

Differences between a traditional hierarchy and a holocracy:

<table style="width:100%table-layout:fixed">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Traditional Hierarchy</th>
      <th>Holocracy</th>
    <tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Work assigned to people</td>
      <td>Work assigned to roles</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Fixed job descriptions</td>
      <td>Fluidity between roles</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Accountable to manager</td>
      <td>Accountable to circle</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Power must be allowed</td>
      <td>Allowed power by default</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

# Roles

Roles may be divided into circles with their own roles, **recursively**.

--

Roles consist of:
- Purpose
- Domain
- Accountabilities
- Compensation

--

Each member may have more than one role, and each role may be filled by more than one member.

---

# RWDWC Initial Roles

- Architecture
- Aesthetics
- Content Creation
- Administrative
- Marketing

???

These initial roles will probably only exist as roles, not circles for a very short time, after which...

---

# Role Splitting

Each role has its accountabilities, which as the company grows may become too large for one person to handle many. At this point the role may be turned into a circle, and roles defined within it, which may or may not match the initial role's accountabilities.

--

Depending on the evolution of the company, the split may look like this:

Aesthetics ->
- User Experience Designer
- Visual Designer
- Cinemetographer


---

# So how do I get paid?


---

# Skills & Levels

Each member has a number of skills, and levels within that skill.

???

Members must be nominated in a skill, and increase that skill's level through either education or work

---

Someone comes to the coop: "I want a website that does SoLoMo, bro"

--

Those in the Administrative/Proposal role put together a SoLoMoPro

--

The proposers also work in other circles and consult those circles as to how the project should be created.

--

The contract includes a price and dependencies like:
- `PHP>3<7*4`
- `Copy>3<8*2`
- `VGFX<3*5`
- `VGFX>6*1`

--

???

Step 3: if there are disagreements as to a fundamental architecture or aesthetic choice, a vote may be taken or multiple proposals submitted

---

# `VGFX<3*5`

```
VGFX: Vector Graphics

<3: At level 3 or lower

*5: Five shares of compensation
```

This means that the project depends on five shares of work by someone with skill in Vector Graphics at level 3 or lower. Translated: project needs a junior designer to create a lot of vector graphics.

---

Before the proposal is signed, members fitting the dependencies are nominated, which they can turn down.

--

Members may split a dependency between them, up to the number of shares.

--

If all dependencies are filled, the proposal is presented to the client.

--

The number of shares each member holds is multiplied by their level in that skill for the percentage of compensation they receive.

---

With structure covered, let's talk about philosophy for a second.

We've covered the Rouchdale Principles:
- Voluntary and open membership &#x2713;
- Democratic member control &#x2713;
- Member economic participation &#x2713;
- Autonomy and independence &#x2713;
- Education, training, and information &#x2713;
- Cooperation among cooperatives &#x2713; (if others exist)
- Concern for community ?

How does a web developer cooperative demonstrate concern for its community?

---

# Concern for Community

Encouraging its members to be charitable is not enough. The organization needs to recognize its role in the community, find ways in which it can positively enact that role, and correct ways in which it negatively enacts that role.

--

## Q. What is a web developer's role in the community?

Well, in theory, the web will replace or become integrated with every physical manifestation of human expression. Signs, writing, drawing, construction are all facilitated by the interlinking of information that is the web. So if the purpose of human expression is to convey ideas, the role of the web developer is...

---

## A. Promoting ideas
Web development is about promoting ideas.
- Site developers promote the product, service or organization of the site
- App developers promote the application
- Advertisers promote a product

---

# Positive Promotion of Ideas

Everyone hopes that they are promoting positive ideas:
- A site for a cause we're interested in
- A community site
- A product for a friend

We should continue to use our skills for ideas we are earnestly interested in.

---

# Negative Promotion of Ideas

However, promotion (our primary duty) is <u>selling</u>.

--

**Money cannot be made, only given and taken.**

--

**Selling involves taking money from people.**

---

Edward Bernays was the nephew of Sigmund Freud, and used his uncle's research to sell products to people, inventing the term **"The Engineering of Consent"**.

His techniques involved using the audience's unconscious desires to manipulate them into buying.

Since then, his techniques have become so pervasive that marketers unconsciously use these manipulation techniques.

## Selling Honestly

This cooperative is committed to factual representation as both a matter of its clients' interests and the interests of consumers. This committment exists to prevent negative ramifications due to later disclosure, as well as to provide the most accurate information to the clients' intended customer.
