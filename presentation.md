# What is a Worker's Cooperative?

A workers' cooperative is a corporate structure in which each member is a voting member of equal standing. Members also own shares, and the primary shareholders are the workers.

Workers' cooperatives exist to allow each member of an organization equal input and a certain level of self-governance.

# Why a Web Developer Cooperative?

> Anyone who creates content:
>
> - Code
> - Words
> - Videos
> - Images
>
> is in web development.

The internet allows people to have more than one professional skill. People who work with the internet exemplify this.
- Some of these skills are specialties
- Some of these skills are hobbies

The internet also allows people to more easily go into business themselves, especially web developers. However,
- While we each may have _most_ of the skills to make a site,
- We _will_ lack a few.
- The areas in which we lack skill become the weak point of the product

???

I say this because I personally have experienced many sites like this: created by someone really good at one area like user experience, client interaction, or coding, but demonstrating a severe lack in other areas

## So...

---

# This workers' cooperative exists to

- Provide a structure through which members may
  - Apply their specialties
  - Hone their interests
  - Work for a profit
--
- Harness the complex skillsets of members towards the needs of its clients

# Holocracy
In order to manage this decentralization of power, the cooperative will incorporate the principles of holacracy.

# What is Holocracy?

[Holocracy](http://holocracy.org) is a governance structure in which the work of the organization is divided into roles, and employees of the company are elected to fill those roles for as long as they exist.

Differences between a traditional hierarchy and a holocracy:

# Roles

Roles may be divided into circles with their own roles, **recursively**.
--
Roles consist of:
- Purpose
- Domain
- Accountabilities
- Compensation
--
Each member may have more than one role, and each role may be filled by more than one member, as long as a compensation plan can be established.

# RWDWC Initial Roles

- Architecture
- Aesthetics
- Content Creation
- Financial
- Marketing

???

These initial roles will probably only exist as roles, not circles for a very short time, after which...

---

# Role Splitting

Each role has its accountabilities, which as the company grows may become too large for one person to handle many. At this point the role may be turned into a circle, and roles defined within it, which may or may not match the initial role's accountabilities.

Depending on the evolution of the company, the split may look like this:

Aesthetics ->
- User Experience Designer
- Visual Designer
- Cinemetographer




Each role will have a % compensation associated with it, which it may then further divide among its comprising roles or circles. This % comes from the general fund. The general fund is financed by a % of each project completed by the cooperative

With structure covered, let's talk about philosophy for a second. This isn't just another online marketing company.

We've covered the Rouchdale Principles:
- Voluntary and open membership &#x2713;
- Democratic member control &#x2713;
- Member economic participation &#x2713;
- Autonomy and independence &#x2713;
- Education, training, and information &#x2713;
- Cooperation among cooperatives &#x2713; (if others exist)
- Concern for community ?

How does a web developer cooperative demonstrate concern for its community?

---

# Concern for Community

Encouraging its members to be charitable is not enough. The organization needs to recognize its role in the community, find ways in which it can positively enact that role, and correct ways in which it negatively enacts that role.

--

## Q. What is a web developer's role in the community?

Well, in theory, the web will replace or become integrated with every physical manifestation of human expression. Signs, writing, drawing, construction are all facilitated by the interlinking of information that is the web. So if the purpose of human expression is to convey ideas, the role of the web developer is...

---

## A. Promoting ideas
Web development is about promoting ideas.
- Site developers promote the product, service or organization of the site
- App developers promote the application
- Advertisers promote a product

---

# Positive Promotion of Ideas

Everyone hopes that they are promoting positive ideas:
- A site for a cause we're interested in
- A community site
- A product for a friend

We should continue to use our skills for ideas we are earnestly interested in.

---

# Negative Promotion of Ideas

However, promotion (our primary duty) is <u>selling</u>.
--
**Money cannot be made, only given and taken.**
--
**Selling involves taking money from people.**

Edward Bernays was the nephew of Sigmund Freud, and used his uncle's research to sell products to people, inventing the term **"The Engineering of Consent"**.

His techniques involved using the audience's unconscious desires to manipulate them into buying.

Since then, his techniques have become so pervasive that marketers unconsciously use these manipulation techniques.

This committment exists to prevent negative ramifications due to later disclosure, as well as to provide the most accurate information to the clients' intended customer.
