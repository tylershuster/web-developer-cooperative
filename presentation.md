# What is a Worker's Cooperative?

A workers' cooperative is a corporate structure in which each member is a voting member of equal standing. Members also own shares, and the primary shareholders are the workers.

Workers' cooperatives exist to allow each member of an organization equal input and a certain level of self-governance.

People 'these days' and people who work on the internet especially have a number of skills, in some of which they specialize and in others they dabble with the hope of becoming better.

It seems to be that web developers hope to go into business themselves making websites, where they specialize in _most_ or many of the skills required to make a client's site, but lack the skills to complete the entire project at the same level of quality.*

So, this workers' cooperative exists to
- harness the multifaceted skillsets of those in web development towards the medium- and large-scale efforts of its clients
- allow its members to
- - apply their specialties
- - hone their interests
- - work for a profit

In order to manage this decentralization of power, the cooperative will incorporate the principles of holacracy.

*I say this because I personally have experienced many sites like this: created by someone really good at one area like user experience, client interaction, or coding, but demonstrating a severe lack in other areas

# What is Holocracy?

Holocracy is a governance structure in which the work to be done is divided into roles, and employees of the company are elected to fill those roles for as long as they exist.

Differences between holacracy & traditional hierarchy:


Roles may be divided into circles with their own roles, recursively.

Roles consist of:
- Purpose
- Domain
- Accountabilities
- Compensation

Each member may have more than one role, and each role may be filled by more than one member, as long as a compensation plan can be established.

# Initial Roles

- Architecture
- Aesthetic
- Content
- Financial
- Marketing

(These are in addition to the roles required by legal incorporation.)

These initial roles will probably only exist as roles, not circles for a very short time, after which...

# Role Splitting

Each role has its accountabilities, which as the company grows may become too large for one person to handle many. At this point the role may be turned into a circle, and roles defined within it, which may or may not match the initial role's accountabilities.

Depending on the evolution of the company, the split may look like this:

Aesthetic ->
- User Experience Designer
- Visual Designer
- Cinemetographer




Each role will have a % compensation associated with it, which it may then further divide among its comprising roles or circles. This % comes from the general fund. The general fund is financed by a % of each project completed by the cooperative

# Concern for Community

So how does a web developer cooperative demonstrate concern for its community? Encouraging its members to be charitable is not enough. The organization needs to recognize its role in the community, find ways in which it can positively enact that role, and correct ways in which it negatively enacts that role.

## Q. What is a web developer's role in the community?

Well, in theory, the web will replace or become integrated with every physical manifestation of human expression. Signs, writing, drawing, construction are all facilitated by the interlinking of information that is the web. So if the purpose of human expression is to convey ideas, the job of the web developer is...

## A. Promotion of ideas

# Positive Promotion of Ideas

# Negative Promotion of Ideas

Recognizing that the role of web development is to sell or otherwise market a product, service, or company, this cooperative is committed to factual representation as both a matter of its clients' interests and the interests of consumers. This committment exists to prevent negative ramifications due to later disclosure, as well as to provide the most accurate information to the clients' intended customer.
