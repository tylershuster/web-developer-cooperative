#Redding Web Developers' Workers' Cooperative

##Introduction

The internet has more content than humanity has yet seen. Its systems are the most complicated yet and help us to automate our tasks at play and at work. However, mankind still faces its perennial problems: the rich seek to get richer and benefit from the ignorance of the poor. While the internet is the largest source of information, the quality of the information remains the same. Much of the information on the internet, and the most readily accessible, is created primarily for the goal of profit. The wealthy employ the less wealthy to create machines to pull in more profit. Money cannot be made, it can only be taken and given.
This being said, the system of wealth exchange relies on value tokens: everyone 'needs' money to survive. Business owners without a selfish thought in their mind, who are only trying to support themselves, may turn to manipulation in the course of their business to bring in more money. Web developers whose goal is only the creation of technically-excellent work may cut corners and produce flawed systems in an effort to meet deadlines, please management, and fulfil a client's request.

It is impossible to right this system in any steps that can be deliniated. This problem is endemic to humanity and generations of philosophers and theologians have been unable to create a mechanism to solve it. Therefore, this document does not imply that it can right any of these wrongs. It does, however, describe a system which recognizes this human tendency and attempts to codify a method of transaction that avoids the seeming necessity of moral comprimise. It applies this attempt to the foundation of a cooperative web development agency that utilizes the strengths of its members in equal representation, and does so without a governing body except the code through which it is created. It is the hope of this author that platforms like Ethereum will one day make it possible for all organizational government to be codified, allowing the workers within the cooperative to focus on their skills without comprimising their time for the sake of beauracracy. It utilizes the principles of distribution and decentralization, couples them with those same principles as applied through the internet, and sets a standard for the members of the cooperative.

'Web Developer': one whose primary work is to create intellectual property. Currently this may seem like an over-generalization but this author believes that all intellectual proprty will eventually become part of the same inter-linked system. Contrast intellectual property with inherent property: physical objects.

The job of many if not most web developers presently is to create systems of information ('web sites') for their clients, who are usually businesses looking to promote themselves, either directly or through their products, services, or events. This promotion can broadly be referred to as advertising. Due largely to the influence of Edward Bernays, modern advertising is not simply factual e.g. "Gilette sells razors with four blades on a rotating ball for $6.99". Modern advertising seeks to manipulate potential customers into believing something about their product, a way in which it will positively affect their life. This method of advertising is two-faced, in that it appears to be looking out for the good of others but is motivated by profit. Even advertisers who genuinely believe in the value of the advertised product cannot be qualified to make most of the statements seen in advertising today. In addition, that 'belief' in the value of the product blinds the advertiser to other options, most significantly the motivating principles of the producing entities, and the means for which they will use their profits.
These systems of information which have strayed so far from being purely factual representations of their products have had an unknown but significant effect on modern culture. The wealthy, who have access to education and information unavailable to the poor, use that education to promote their own wealth-gathering systems of information. The poor, ignorant of the system of manipulation inherent in advertising, are convinced to buy and buy. After all, if one believes the messages in advertising, buying a handful of these modern miracle products should make one happy beyond all human reckoning. But this system of consumption destroys the uneducated or unfortunate, leading them to unhappiness by reducing their wealth. Because they still have not seen the method by which they are being oppressed, they blame their unhappiness not on the system of manipulation (therefore freeing themselves from it), but on others, or themselves, leading to destructive tendencies. This also leads many to believe in the existence of conspiracies. The greatest conspiracy is the one in which almost everyone is a conspirator - the conspiracy to assign value to money. Money is just a system of information, a piece of intellectual property. Physical objects have the value of their utility, but money is inherently worthless and only assigned value by consensus - by conspiracy.

All members of agency have own business license.

##Contracts

A client makes a contract with the cooperative, which specifies which members are involved and to what extent. The contract is for worked performed and is a composite contract which consists of multiple contracts with the project technicians. For example, John Doe contracts a website project with Tyler, Jesse, and Jack. John's agreement with Tyler stipulates that Tyler will perform up to 20 hours of site development before the contract is renegociated. Tyler's contract with the cooperative specifies the type of work that he is to perform (information architecture, node.js & PHP language programming, CSS development). John's agreement with Jesse stipulates that Jesse will furnish 15 specific graphics, taking a maximum of three hours each with a project max of 30 hours, before the contract is renegociated. Jack's contract with John stipulates that he will produce wireframes, site mockups, and ancillary site development, up to 20 hours before contract renegotiation.

Contract renegotiation can occur but only after the work agreed on has been completed. Milestones are specified in each contract. For example, each of Jesse's graphics for John could qualify as a milestone. Each graphic is worth $200, and there is a bonus for completing the contract. This way, the client can pull out at any time without having to pay the bonus but the technicians will each be compensated for time spent.

Example Contract:
Tyler
agrees to develop examplesite.com for 20 hours.
Required Tasks (failure to complete will result in breach of contract):
Set up a camel.js website platform on asmallorange hosting at domain name examplesite.com
Create site structure with the following pages: /x, /y, /z
Create a system which John Doe can use to modify the listed pages including image upload, text insertion, and basic WYSIWYG editing, as defined in the feature set for WYSIWYGtool.com

Expected Tasks (if incomplete after 20 hours, may be completed at reduced hourly rate):
X Y Z

Additional Tasks (to be completed if project is ahead of schedule):
Clients may choose to ignore this section

Each member of the cooperative has a contract with the cooperative (i.e. each other member) specifying their contribution to the cooperative
These member contracts are fluid and depend on the skills each member holds. Member contracts specify the languages (has to be more than just computer languages, including 'logo', 'photo composite', etc) that the member knows, and the degree to which (they/the group agrees) they are proficient in them. Members may add or remove skills, and they and the group rank their skill level as they contribute to the group.

Can this be run on Ethereum?

Members must:
-Be committed to a high degree of technical excellence, as set forth in the cooperative's style guides, to which any member can submit changes for group consideration
-Be committed to a high ethical standard - understanding that most development projects will be for the purpose of marketing, agree to not partake in any work which seeks to undermine the public's consciousness for the sake of profit. (examples set forth in...) All statements made must be factual and are open to dispute by other members of the cooperative
-Release their work under the GPL, MIT, or no license

TRUTH is more important than MONEY
OPENNESS is more important than SUCCESS

We hold these statements to be true:
-Web pages are always changing, and the requirements for what they can do are always expanding.
-There have been no perfect websites yet
-Open-source technology forms the only platforms which have hope of longevity
-The internet is ideally a representation of all human-categorized information about a subject
-Search engines, the primary method through which website are discovered, seek to find the information most relevant to their user's query
-Exaggerating or falsifying information about an organization for the effort of search engine visibility corrupts the internet and will always eventually be eradicated by algorithm
Therefore:
-Internet engineers should seek to create the most-accurate, most-organized version of an organization's information
-Copy on the internet that purports to represent an organization should be factual and defensible
-Because no web project can ever be considered fully complete, internet engineers should seek the highest level of standards-compliance and design systems with infinite outward expansion as a possibility.
-Systems should be modular and upgradable with a minimum amount of work by future engineers
-Requirements for understanding and upgrading a system should be clearly documented in a conspicuous place within the system

Style Guides:
Style guides for each language used by the cooperative will contain syntax guidelines as well as design patterns for common architectures. Members are encouraged to add their own patterns to the library and nominate exceptional patterns for standard practice.


When a new client approaches the cooperative, all interested members will have a chance to join the initial consultation and must be included on all conversation occurring prior to the initial meeting. Any conversation between a member of the cooperative and a potential client between the date of the client's initial contact and the date of the initial group meeting will be considered a breach of contract. In the initial meeting the client will present their needs and cooperative members can ask questions. They may answer questions posed directly to them by the potential client, but may not make 'sales pitches' in the initial meeting.
After this initial meeting, cooperative members may choose to withdraw. Those remaining will offer their skills as specifically applied to the project. If interested members cannot offer the skills required, the contract must be refused. If it is determined by all participating members that the combined offers will produce the outcome desired by the client, the contract can be drawn up and presented to the client by all participating members.


##Dispute Resolution
Disputes may arise between cooperative members or between members and clients. Cooperative members may dispute the best course of action for a client's project. Say Tyler wants to build a website with WordPress and Eric wants to build the website with Drupal. Members will be given a chance to present their case to other members involved in the contract and must argue for both the pros and cons of their method. In the event that a 75% majority consensus cannot be reached, members are therefore agreeing that they do not wish to give up their case and may continue with the project simultaneously, and must take it upon themselves to resolve any conflict of resources with other involved members. In the case that a project has two simultaneous developments, the contract payout will be awarded after completion. The winning party will be determined by the amalgate of the client's impression plus a code review score determined by other experts. Ultimately the client has final say but they will be advised on the quality of the code by the agency. This is to prevent pandering to the client's interests in order to win a contract while neglecting technical excellence.
