#Redding Web Developer Cooperative

##Introduction

Include statement about context of creator's religious backgrounds, realize that these things have been left undeclared to the shame and guilt, &c

The Internet has more content than humanity has yet seen. It is the most complicated system ever created and helps us to automate our tasks at play and at work. However, mankind still faces many of its perennial problems. One of those is that the rich use their wealth to acquire more. That wealth comes from the poor, and is taken by exploiting their ignorance. Their ignorance is perpetuated by their poverty. While the Internet is the largest source of information, the quality of the information remains the same. Much of the information on the Internet is created primarily for the goal of profit. The most readily-accessible information is created and promoted in the service of the wealthy, who employ the less wealthy to curate it for them. It is important to note here a derivation of the law of conservation of mass: **Money cannot be made**, it can only be taken and given.

The primary mechanism by which people acquire disproportionate wealth is manipulation. By manipulating the environment in which the people from whom they take money live, they can convince them to give the money they have

Those who feel they have enough money are more motivated to give their wealth. Those who feel they do not lack that motivation.

This being said, the system of wealth exchange relies on value tokens: everyone needs money to survive in the present system. Intrinsically, money is not necessary. It is a human abstraction of value to keep track of compensation.  Business owners without a selfish thought in their mind, who are only trying to support themselves, may turn to manipulation in the course of their business to bring in more money. Web developers whose goal is only the creation of technically-excellent work may cut corners and produce flawed systems in an effort to meet deadlines, please management, and fulfill a client's request.

It is impossible to right this system in any steps that can be delineated. This problem is endemic to humanity and generations of philosophers and theologians have been unable to create a mechanism to solve it. Therefore, this document should not imply that it can right any of these wrongs. It does, however, describe a system which recognizes this human tendency and attempts to codify a method of transaction that avoids the seeming necessity of moral compromise. It applies this attempt to the foundation of a cooperative web development agency that utilizes the strengths of its members in equal representation, and does so without a governing body except the code through which it is created. It is the hope of this author that platforms like Ethereum will one day make it possible for all organizational government to be codified, allowing the workers within the cooperative to focus on their skills without compromising their time for the sake of bureaucracy. It utilizes the principles of distribution and decentralization, couples them with those same principles as applied through the Internet, and sets a standard for the members of the cooperative.



The job of many if not most web developers presently is to create systems of information ('web sites') for their clients, who are usually businesses looking to promote themselves, either directly or through their products, services, or events. This promotion can broadly be referred to as advertising. Due largely to the influence of Edward Bernays, modern advertising is not simply factual e.g. "Gilette sells razors with four blades on a rotating ball for $6.99". Modern advertising seeks to manipulate potential customers into believing something about their product, a way in which it will positively affect their life. This method of advertising is two-faced, in that it appears to be looking out for the good of others but is motivated by profit. Even advertisers who genuinely believe in the value of the advertised product cannot be qualified to make most of the statements seen in advertising today. In addition, that 'belief' in the value of the product blinds the advertiser to other options, most significantly the motivating principles of the producing entities, and the means for which they will use their profits.
These systems of information which have strayed so far from being purely factual representations of their products have had an unknown but significant effect on modern culture. The wealthy, who have access to education and information unavailable to the poor, use that education to promote their own wealth-gathering systems of information. The poor, ignorant of the system of manipulation inherent in advertising, are convinced to buy and buy. After all, if one believes the messages in advertising, buying a handful of these modern miracle products should make one happy beyond all human reckoning. But this system of consumption destroys the uneducated or unfortunate, leading them to unhappiness by reducing their wealth. Because they still have not seen the method by which they are being oppressed, they blame their unhappiness not on the system of manipulation (therefore freeing themselves from it), but on others, or themselves, leading to destructive tendencies. This also leads many to believe in the existence of conspiracies. The greatest conspiracy is the one in which almost everyone is a conspirator - the conspiracy to assign value to money. Money is just a system of information, a piece of intellectual property. Physical objects have the value of their utility, but money is inherently worthless and only assigned value by consensus - by conspiracy.

My interest is not to equally distribute existing money across all members of humanity. I understand that for a man to eat, he must work. I have no interest in robbing the rich to feed the poor. However I am interested in re-shaping the systems of economy which have allowed the rich to rob the poor under the guise of legality by controlling methods of education while using their knowledge for profit.

My intention for the cooperative is to aid in the transformation of labor - to provide an example of how we can work together, not dependent on a human authority but governed by our own impetus toward authenticity. The impetus which drives me rejects hierarchical authority and so to do the work I have been given I hope to create or otherwise work within a power structure that is able to channel high creative energy into refined products. Works of lasting quality and high value must be created by satisfied individuals, not mechanically or begrudgingly.

The structure of work tends toward this decentralization, evidenced by the movement towards smaller units of organization. In antiquity the labor force was orchestrated by the emperor. Since then, control of the laborers who are those doing the productive work (as opposed their managers) has been divided into smaller units, sequentially: kings, lords, barons, factory owners, foremen, CEOs, managers. This has been the necessary process to organize humans, within each of whom exists the struggle between laziness and motivation. The termination of this process occurs when each laborer is responsible for their own labor. This termination will occur simultaneously with the actualization of each human being - until then we will continue to see increasingly complex divisions. These divisions will be hard to comprehend and navigate for those who want to control others and/or want to be paid without doing productive work. The breaking-down of power structures moves toward the benefit of those who find fulfillment in exercising their talents.



We are a workerâ€™s cooperative located in Redding, California. We are a group of professionals whose primary skills are related to the production of internet properties, such as webpages, websites, or apps.
Each of these properties requires many different skills. The internet enables us to individually create complex web properties because we can lean on software or services that automate many tasks. These are essentially robots; they do complex tasks in a predefined way more quickly than a human. The web is full of robots, like so many marionettes.
But the more we lean on robots, the poorer the resulting work becomes:
Robot-generated code is harder to update, easier to compromise, slower and more buggy.
Robotic designs are formulaic and become outdated as people recognize patterns or the fad fades.
As a cooperative effort, we combine our skills to create richer properties that can be used boldly for years.
As a cooperative effort, we create visual experiences & mental symphonies.
We are artists & scholars.
We hope to be scientists.
We support each other through our strengths.
We are considering patrons.

About the Effort
This is a cooperative effort of professionals in the Redding area to create digital properties and maintain those that they create.
It may consider maintenance of existing properties subject to a code review.
The types of web properties it can create will vary according to its membership.
Members may bring existing clients or maintain them individually.
The organization of this cooperative effort is holarchical.
That is;
* Each member must be entitled to an equal say to decisions generated by their division,
* Each division must be entitled to an equal say to decisions affecting the organization of this effort.
Proposals must be agreed upon unanimously by all members of their context, and in their original form.
This effort intends to educate to empower its members and clients.
That is; it educates
* Members professionally to empower them to create better work,
* Clients to the nature of what they are buying and how to maintain it.
This effort uses distributed and decentralized open-source software when available.
The properties created by this effort are licensed under the Creative Commons 0 license, except where to do so would pose a threat.
Members are expected to consider but not required to participate in projects that it undertakes.
The corporation of this effort has no political, religious, ethnic, ethical, or other philosophical affiliations; however, members are free to act on the basis of their own.
* Members do not speak for the effort, and the corporation of the effort does not speak for its members.
* Both, however, represent the other and are expected to act respectively.
Any canonical statements made by the corporation of this effort must be agreed upon unanimously, and represent only the concurrent members.
Members will be compensated proportionally according to the value they contributed to the project.
* This value will be calculated with each contract, and for each language they contribute to the project.
* Languages include programming languages, visual languages (UX, UI), and other language-like skills including vector graphic design, &c.
* Membersâ€™ score for each language will be determined by reviews of their exemplary work.
* These reviews will be double-blind and weighted according to the reviewerâ€™s skill with the same language.
