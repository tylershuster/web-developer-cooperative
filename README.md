#Redding Web Developer Cooperative

This book will attempt to explain the incorporation of a cooperative effort of web developers, specifically in the region of Redding, California. The purpose of this book is threefold: **1** to explain the need for a cooperative work structure, especially within the trade of web development; **2** to explain the need to correct and the mechanisms by which advertising fosters unhealthy manipulation, recognizing that it is the task with which most web development agencies are concerned; and **3** to incorporate an effort which addresses both these needs.




##Elevator Pitch

We are a worker’s cooperative located in Redding, California. We are a group of professionals whose primary skills are related to the production of internet properties, such as webpages, websites, or apps.
Each of these properties requires many different skills. The internet enables us to individually create complex web properties because we can lean on software or services that automate many tasks. These are essentially robots; they do complex tasks in a predefined way more quickly than a human. The web is full of robots, like so many marionettes.
But the more we lean on robots, the poorer the resulting work becomes:
Robot-generated code is harder to update, easier to compromise, slower and more buggy.
Robotic designs are formulaic and become outdated as people recognize patterns or the fad fades.
As a cooperative effort, we combine our skills to create richer properties that can be used boldly for years.
As a cooperative effort, we create visual experiences & mental symphonies.
We are artists & scholars.
We hope to be scientists.
We support each other through our strengths.
We are considering patrons.

##About the Effort
This is a cooperative effort of professionals in the Redding area to create digital properties and maintain those that they create.
