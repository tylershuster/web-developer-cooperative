# Deception Techniques


http://www.scs.sk.ca/cyber/elem/learningcommunity/english/media20/curr_content/media20/unit_4/adclaims.htm
"the reason so many ad claims fall into the category of pseudo-information is that they are applied to parity products. parity products are those in which all or most of the brands available are nearly identical. since not one superior product exists, advertising is used to create the illusion of superiority. the largest advertising budgets are devoted to parity products such as gasoline, cigarettes, beer and soft drinks, soaps, and various headache and cold remedies"
According to the rules of parity, the word "best" means "equally as good as other products in the category" and the word "better" means "better than other products in the category." In this sense, the word "better" means better than best. This kind of hyperbolic language promotes unrealistic expectations and a mutation of language. While language naturally mutates, that responsibility should be fulfilled by the commoner and not motivated by money. Language that is manipulated by money becomes focused on money.

The following claims are technically true, but for reasons outlined in this document should be culled from the language of advertising. These claims all imply something, never explicitly say anything. This plants a doubt or a suggestion in the viewer's mind.

###Weasel Claims
"Product X helps reduce symptom Y"
helps, many, virtually, basically, fights, controls, comforts, acts, can be, up to, refreshes, 'just like'

###Unfinished Claims
"Product X gives you more"
"Product X has 250% more"
"Product X costs half as much"
These claims omit some truth

###Appeal to Individuality
"There's no other X like it"
Implies that if something is unique or different, it is desirable

###Tautological Claims
"Our qualified professionals"
These claims are claims which are true of any product in the category, or which add a superlative adverb or adjective that is redundant given the verb or noun it describes

###The "So What" Claim
"Product X has twice as much Y as Product Z"

###The Vague Claim
"The end of meatloaf boredom"

###The Artificial Endorsement
"Whovian X uses Product Y" (because we paid them to)

###The Twisted Statistic
"Contains a drop of retsyn" (an invented term for vegetable oil)
"Created by a research scientist"

###Flattery
"We think a cigar smoker is someone special"
"The lady has taste"
These claims appeal to the ethos of someone who is already likely to use the product by complimenting someone similar to them whether in words or through imagery

###The Rhetorical Question
"Could your hands use a small miracle"
These questions always have an obvious answer intended for the consumer to unconsciously (or consciously) answer "yes" or "no" to start a conversation in which the advertiser is right

###Special Offer
"Buy product X and recieve product Y free" (even if you didn't want either beforehand)
Special offers aren't always manipulative. However, when used for the purpose of sales instead of: providing a helpful accessory or because of a product surplus, they usually are

###Bandwagon
"Everyone uses product X"

###Appeal to Charity
"Buying product X makes (your family/your friends/your world) happier"

hyperbole
-"-est" claims
Xmongering
-fearmongering "If you don't do X that profits us, woe will befall you"
--also, promoting a state of fear like "Is your kid next?" (the implication is that buying this magazine will help you keep your child safe)
-statusmongering "if you do X that profits us, you will appear in Y way to Z people"
Inventing words "whisk away obesogens"
-Associating emotions with products through linguistic primitives introduces complexity to language and corrupts the untrained/common perceiver's vocabulary
Un-, parenthetically, or implicitly qualified claims

The reason that these needs, associations, and fears are so powerful is that they resonate with most people due only to biology. They invoke a biological response, and advertising that uses that biological response to pull in wealth causes harm
