# Holocratic Structure

Members of this organization agree to be bound by the processes in version 1.0 of the Redding Web Developer Cooperative Constitution, as it exists within this repository. Forked from the [Holocracy Constitution](https://github.com/holacracyone/Holacracy-Constitution).




Unplaced note: Anyone within a holacracy may tell someone else what to do unless otherwise specified, but the other is in no way obligated to do that, unless otherwise specified.
