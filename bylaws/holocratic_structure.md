# Holocratic Structure

Members of this organization agree to be bound by the processes in version 1.0 of the Redding Web Developer Cooperative Constitution. Forked from the [Holocracy Constitution](https://github.com/holacracyone/Holacracy-Constitution).

##Apps
[Badge-based compensation structure](http://www.holacracy.org/badge-based-compensation-app/) fork
- Skills, levels in those skills
- Add badge: support. Easy to get one, but doesn't pay much extra. Harder to get higher levels, but pays a lot. Get levels by being nominated by increasingly others for being helpful
- The relationship between compensation and badge level should follow a formula so that the formula can be changed by consensus and everyone's pay grade is adjusted

Badges can be appointed as described in the badge-based compensation app for holocracy, with the exception that anyone can be nominated for a badge, not only the members of the cooperative. Non-members cannot nominate themselves and holding a badge does not confer membership (voting rights) in the corporation, only recognition of a certain skill.

These badges can be augmented by multipliers, which are tiered according to a formula that prescribes the degree to which the member's shares are augmented during compensation of a project. After each project, a member's skill in the area represented by each badge will be assessed and their multiplier evaluated. After six months with a badge that has not been used, that member's badge is subject to a review which may result in the decrementing of that badge's multiplier.

When a project proposal is adopted, one dependency is defined per task, and the number of shares of compensation the task requires. The dependencies specify both badge level and multiplier. For instance, ```PHP>3<7*4``` claims that the task depends on four shares of work by someone with the PHP badge, between tiers 3 & 7. A single member may claim each task, with higher-level members given priority.

When compensation is alotted, the shares each member has are multiplied by their level at that badge. For example, the member claiming the task in the previous instance would multiply 4 by the multiplier for their badge level to get their adjusted share amount. The total amount of compensation is divided among the members claiming shares.
