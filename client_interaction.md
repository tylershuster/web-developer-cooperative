# Client Interaction

Attribute: https://www.wyro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Web-Dev-Timeline-Infographic-V2.png

Propose -> Contract -> Project -> Produce -> Deploy -> Maintain
(project with accent on 2nd syllable, i.e. to forsee and plan)

Propose: Intial Meeting -> Needs Assessment -> Proposal
Contract: Member Selection -> Timeframe negotiation
Project: Research -> Outline -> Map -> Wireframes
Product: Content Assembly -> Main Layout & Artwork -> 2ndary Layout & Artwork -> Coding -> Testing -> Content Population -> Browser Testing
Deployment:

Each of these phases should be modular; that is, a client should be able to take the result of one phase (or sub-phase) to another agency that best fits their need. This anticipates the existence of other such cooperative agencies, and hopes to deliniate a system in which the client receives the best service while ensuring the agency (w.c.)'s members are compensated for their work

PROPOSAL
--------

When a potential client requests proposals from the cooperative, any interested member may write a proposal. In it must be specified languages required so that the cooperative has a mechanism by which to determine members for eligibility. Proposals include the projected scope of the project, the included functionality, the languages used, the projected cost (&C?). These proposals should be member-agnostic, though understanding that the user writing the proposal has their own preferences. Therefore, once a proposal is accepted, the cooperative process can decide the best architects & designers of the system. Preference will be given to the instantiating member because they understand most clearly the goal of the proposal. However, if meetings with the client make it clear that another member resonates more clearly with both the client's wishes and the product of the proposal, the instantiating member is not necessarily included on the project.

If no members are interested, the cooperative may choose to decline the RFP or make a single proposal

RFP Form:
-Client brief
-Needs
-current solution
(not a project brief - this assumes that most clients have a limited understanding of the scope of work possible, and that they should be presented with options)

CONTRACT
--------

A client makes a contract with the cooperative, which specifies which members are involved and to what extent. The contract is for worked performed and is a composite contract which consists of multiple contracts with the project technicians. For example, John Doe contracts a website project with Tyler, Jesse, and Jack. John's agreement with Tyler stipulates that Tyler will perform up to 20 hours of site development before the contract is renegociated. Tyler's contract with the cooperative specifies the type of work that he is to perform (information architecture, node.js & PHP language programming, CSS development). John's agreement with Jesse stipulates that Jesse will furnish 15 specific graphics, taking a maximum of three hours each with a project max of 30 hours, before the contract is renegociated. Jack's contract with John stipulates that he will produce wireframes, site mockups, and ancillary site development, up to 20 hours before contract renegotiation.

Contract renegotiation can occur but only after the work agreed on has been completed. Milestones are specified in each contract. For example, each of Jesse's graphics for John could qualify as a milestone. Each graphic is worth $200, and there is a bonus for completing the contract. This way, the client can pull out at any time without having to pay the bonus but the technicians will each be compensated for time spent.

Example Contract:
Tyler
agrees to develop examplesite.com for 20 hours.
Required Tasks (failure to complete will result in breach of contract):
Set up a camel.js website platform on asmallorange hosting at domain name examplesite.com
Create site structure with the following pages: /x, /y, /z
Create a system which John Doe can use to modify the listed pages including image upload, text insertion, and basic WYSIWYG editing, as defined in the feature set for WYSIWYGtool.com

Expected Tasks (if incomplete after 20 hours, may be completed at reduced hourly rate):
X Y Z

Additional Tasks (to be completed if project is ahead of schedule):

Style Guides:
Style guides for each language used by the cooperative will contain syntax guidelines as well as design patterns for common architectures. Members are encouraged to add their own patterns to the library and nominate exceptional patterns for standard practice.


When a new client approaches the cooperative, all interested members will have a chance to join the initial consultation and must be included on all conversation occurring prior to the initial meeting. Any conversation between a member of the cooperative and a potential client between the date of the client's initial contact and the date of the initial group meeting will be considered a breach of contract. In the initial meeting the client will present their needs and cooperative members can ask questions. They may answer questions posed directly to them by the potential client, but may not make 'sales pitches' in the initial meeting.
After this initial meeting, cooperative members may choose to withdraw. Those remaining will offer their skills as specifically applied to the project. If interested members cannot offer the skills required, the contract must be refused. If it is determined by all participating members that the combined offers will produce the outcome desired by the client, the contract can be drawn up and presented to the client by all participating members.


##Dispute Resolution
Disputes may arise between cooperative members or between members and clients. Cooperative members may dispute the best course of action for a client's project. Say Tyler wants to build a website with WordPress and Eric wants to build the website with Drupal. Members will be given a chance to present their case to other members involved in the contract and must argue for both the pros and cons of their method. In the event that a 75% majority consensus cannot be reached, members are therefore agreeing that they do not wish to give up their case and may continue with the project simultaneously, and must take it upon themselves to resolve any conflict of resources with other involved members. In the case that a project has two simultaneous developments, the contract payout will be awarded after completion. The winning party will be determined by the amalgate of the client's impression plus a code review score determined by other experts. Ultimately the client has final say but they will be advised on the quality of the code by the agency. This is to prevent pandering to the client's interests in order to win a contract while neglecting technical excellence.






If you’re interested in hiring us, you’ll request proposals. Any interested members may write a proposal. These proposals will include:
* The languages involved in the project
* The projected scope of the project
    * Length of development
    * Price
    * Components involved
* A description of the final product
These proposals will be voted on by cooperative members, and those not rejected will be sent to you. If you accept a proposal, we will form a team of members to work with you based on our members’ ability and availability. Preference will be given to the member whose proposal is accepted. This team of members will write a contract.
This contract will include the price of the project, and how that compensation will be divided among the members. It will also specify milestones, which are criteria upon completion of which you’ll pay us an agreed amount.
 
After the contact has been signed by all of us, we will schedule a meeting in which all members of the team will discuss with you in depth the components of the project.
Following this meeting, we will perform our research and create a technical plan and outline of the final product.
Following approval of this outline, we will create a detailed map of the project, including all pages, modals, &c.
Following approval of this map, we will create mockups to approximate interactions.
Following approval of these mockups, we will work with you to create a content outline.
Following approval of this content outline, you will gather and we will create content for the site.
During this process, the design team will design visual elements to be used on the site, and the development team will create more detailed page layout design.
After the page layout have been confirmed, the development team will code the website.
After initial coding, the development team will test the site’s functionality.
Once we verify that the site functions properly, our team will fill the site with the agreed-upon copy.
After the copy has been inserted, we will test the site for browser & device compatibility.
At this point, you will make a final review of the site to verify that it matches the expected and agreed-upon requirements.
Once the site seems as expected, we will put it through a final round of refinement wherein we add metadata and similar items.
At this point the site will go live.
Once the site is live, we will work with you to train you on the use of the content management system if you are interested in changing the site in the future.
Web properties are supported at a discounted rate for a year following launch.
