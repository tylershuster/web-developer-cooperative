##About the Author

This book we be ingenuine without a brief introduction of the author. I have lived in the Redding, California region for all of my 25 years. I am of German and Scottish descent. I was raised to follow the Christian faith. I was schooled primarily by my parents, both educators, for my non-collegiate educational career. I received my Bachelor's Degree in English in 2011. I have been involved in web development since approximately 2005. I have worked in the field since 2012. Each of these facts informs but should not define what you are about to read.

##Introduction

In this section I attempt to explain some of the mechanisms which have led to the world's current financial situation.

The Internet has more content than humanity has yet seen. It is the most complicated system ever created and helps us to automate our tasks at play and at work. While this automation has undoubtedly facilitated the most significant advances in human society, that society still struggles with many underlying problems it has been unable to solve through any technology. One of those is that the rich use their wealth to acquire more. There is a pervasive understanding that one can "make money," but this violates the law of conservation of mass. **Money cannot be made**. It can only be taken and given.

While there are those whose own foolishness led to their poverty, it cannot be denied that the money of the rich came from the poor. By and large that transfer was facilitated through the exploitation of ignorance. That is one of the points I will attempt to convey in this book.

Information has always come at a certain cost, and so the ignorance of the poor is perpetuated by their poverty. While the Internet is the largest source of information, the quality of the information remains the same. Most high-quality information can only be accessed in exchange for money, and therefore the most common information is mostly low-quality. Much of this common information is created and promoted in the service of the wealthy, who employ the less wealthy to curate it for them. How many times have you visited a webpage looking for an answer and found it trying to convince you to buy a product? How many times have you seen a site with more than three advertisements? How many times have you visisted a site when the screen was covered by a box promoting an offer or product? These articles, advertisements, and pop-up boxes were almost assuredly not created by the person providing the product being sold; rather, by a copywriter, graphic designer, coder, or other web developer.

These promotions were created with the intent of manipulation. By manipulation I mean this: when the viewer first visited the page, they may have not been familiar with the product being sold. In order to convince the unfamiliar viewer to buy the product, the advertiser must first introduce the product, then convince the viewer of their need for it. In traditional advertising, this entire process had to be done blind. With modern tracking technology, advertisers can keep track of a viewer's impressions and modify the advertisements they receive to gradually convince them to buy the product. Most of the time this takes the form of convincing them that they need the product.


The primary mechanism by which people acquire disproportionate wealth is manipulation. By manipulating the environment in which the people from whom they take money live, they can convince them to give the money they have

Those who feel they have enough money are more motivated to give their wealth. Those who feel they do not lack that motivation.

This being said, the system of wealth exchange relies on value tokens: everyone needs money to survive in the present system. Intrinsically, money is not necessary. It is a human abstraction of value to keep track of compensation.  Business owners without a selfish thought in their mind, who are only trying to support themselves, may turn to manipulation in the course of their business to bring in more money. Web developers whose goal is only the creation of technically-excellent work may cut corners and produce flawed systems in an effort to meet deadlines, please management, and fulfill a client's request.

 It does, however, describe a system which recognizes this human tendency and attempts to codify a method of transaction that avoids the seeming necessity of moral compromise. It applies this attempt to the foundation of a cooperative web development agency that utilizes the strengths of its members in equal representation, and does so without a governing body except the code through which it is created. It is the hope of this author that platforms like Ethereum will one day make it possible for all organizational government to be codified, allowing the workers within the cooperative to focus on their skills without compromising their time for the sake of bureaucracy. It utilizes the principles of distribution and decentralization, couples them with those same principles as applied through the Internet, and sets a standard for the members of the cooperative.



The job of many if not most web developers presently is to create systems of information ('web sites') for their clients, who are usually businesses looking to promote themselves, either directly or through their products, services, or events. This promotion can broadly be referred to as advertising. Due largely to the influence of Edward Bernays, modern advertising is not simply factual e.g. "Gilette sells razors with four blades on a rotating ball for $6.99". Modern advertising seeks to manipulate potential customers into believing something about their product, a way in which it will positively affect their life. This method of advertising is two-faced, in that it appears to be looking out for the good of others but is motivated by profit. Even advertisers who genuinely believe in the value of the advertised product cannot be qualified to make most of the statements seen in advertising today. In addition, that 'belief' in the value of the product blinds the advertiser to other options, most significantly the motivating principles of the producing entities, and the means for which they will use their profits.
These systems of information which have strayed so far from being purely factual representations of their products have had an unknown but significant effect on modern culture. The wealthy, who have access to education and information unavailable to the poor, use that education to promote their own wealth-gathering systems of information. The poor, ignorant of the system of manipulation inherent in advertising, are convinced to buy and buy. After all, if one believes the messages in advertising, buying a handful of these modern miracle products should make one happy beyond all human reckoning. But this system of consumption destroys the uneducated or unfortunate, leading them to unhappiness by reducing their wealth. Because they still have not seen the method by which they are being oppressed, they blame their unhappiness not on the system of manipulation (therefore freeing themselves from it), but on others, or themselves, leading to destructive tendencies. This also leads many to believe in the existence of conspiracies. The greatest conspiracy is the one in which almost everyone is a conspirator - the conspiracy to assign value to money. Money is just a system of information, a piece of intellectual property. Physical objects have the value of their utility, but money is inherently worthless and only assigned value by consensus - by conspiracy.

My interest is not to equally distribute existing money across all members of humanity. I understand that for a man to eat, he must work. I have no interest in robbing the rich to feed the poor. However I am interested in re-shaping the systems of economy which have allowed the rich to rob the poor under the guise of legality by controlling methods of education while using their knowledge for profit.


##Intention of this Effort
My intention for the cooperative is to aid in the transformation of labor - to provide an example of how we can work together, not dependent on a human authority but governed by our own impetus toward authenticity. The impetus which drives me rejects hierarchical authority and so to do the work I have been given I hope to create or otherwise work within a power structure that is able to channel high creative energy into refined products. Works of lasting quality and high value must be created by satisfied individuals, not mechanically or begrudgingly.

The structure of work tends toward this decentralization, evidenced by the movement towards smaller units of organization. In antiquity the labor force was orchestrated by the emperor. Since then, control of the laborers who are those doing the productive work (as opposed their managers) has been divided into smaller units, sequentially: kings, lords, barons, factory owners, foremen, CEOs, managers. This has been the necessary process to organize humans, within each of whom exists the struggle between laziness and motivation. The termination of this process occurs when each laborer is responsible for their own labor. This termination will occur simultaneously with the actualization of each human being - until then we will continue to see increasingly complex divisions. These divisions will be hard to comprehend and navigate for those who want to control others and/or want to be paid without doing productive work. The breaking-down of power structures moves toward the benefit of those who find fulfillment in exercising their talents.




This represents a flip considering compensation and work. It seems that many companies exist to bring in compensation. The purpose of this company is to apportion work to fulfilled individuals, and the compensation is what flows out as a result of completed work.





This page represents the philosophy of this effort, the reasons and the methods to enact those reasons.
## We Do This For You
Recognizing:
* that the creation of intellectual property to promote a party which sells goods (es.g. a website, business cards, branding materials) involves the promotion of those goods in an environment saturated by similar promotions,
* that this media-saturated environment comprises [supernormal] stimuli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernormal_stimulus),
* that these supernormal stimuli have instigated negative ecological and psychological effects,
* and that given access to objective information about a good or service, prospective buyers will tend toward the [parity product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_product) with the greatest value;
this effort commits to creating intellectual properties which objectively and minimally promote their project, and to make the value of those products apparent by their own merits, and not through lies or exaggeration.
IN SUM: We are passionate about the quality of our craft and we work with others who are.

## We Do This For Us
Recognizing:
* that works created for profit at the expense of quality are harder to maintain or upgrade,
* that works created in the pursuit of quality cost more to develop,
* and that while life and livelihood do not depend on monetary throughput, there is an historical tradition of their association in which the members of this effort engage,
this effort commits to developing a method that provides work proportionally for its members determined by their talent, inspiration, and ability alone.
IN SUM: we do this to make money but we want to keep that from corrupting our motivation.
 
We hold these statements regarding our craft to be true:
* Web pages are always changing, and the limits of their capability have not yet ceased to expand.
* There have been no perfect websites yet. All code is contingent upon the stability & security of other code.
* While not all open-source software will be sustainable, the most sustainable software will be open-source.
* The internet is ideally all information that humanity has discerned.
* Search engines, the primary method through which websites are located, seek to find the information most relevant to their user’s query.
* The information contained in a web property should exist for the end user’s enrichment only and not to manipulate the search engine (“gaming the system”).
* Exaggerating or falsifying information about an organization in an effort to increase search engine visibility corrupts the integrity of the internet.
* Additionally, this exaggerated or falsified information will eventually be eradicated by algorithm.
Therefore, to ensure the preservation, discovery, and interlinking of information:
* Internet engineers should seek to create the most accurate, most organized version of an organization’s information.
* Copy (that is, non-structured data) that purports to represent an organization should be based in fact and defensible.
* Internet engineers should seek the highest possible level of standards compliance and design systems with the possibility of unlimited outward expansion in mind.
* Systems should be modular and upgradeable with a minimum amount of work by future engineers. (low technical debt)
* Requirements for understanding and upgrading a system should be clearly documented in a conspicuous place within the system.

## IN SUM
TRUTH IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN MONEY
( this recognizes that some of us tasked with creating words and other representations of ideas have made the decision to value money over honest representation and the world has suffered for it )
OPENNESS IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN SUCCESS
( this recognizes that some keepers of information have concealed facts for the sake of personal success and this has been an expense to the system as a whole )
THIS EFFORT AFFIRMS THAT WORK CREATED AT THE EXPENSE OF ONE’S WHOLE SELF TO THE BENEFIT OF THE LARGER WHOLE WILL BE PROPORTIONALLY MORE FULFILLING, ENDURING, AND USEFUL
